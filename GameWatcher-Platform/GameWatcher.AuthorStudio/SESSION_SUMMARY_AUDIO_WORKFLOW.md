# Audio Workflow Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Session:** Final UX Polish + Audio Management System  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - Build Successful**

---

## 🎯 Completed Tasks

### Track 1: Discovery Grid UX Updates ✅

**Changes Made:**

1. **Inline Audio Buttons**
   - Moved "Attach File" (📎) button into DataGrid as column
   - Moved "Generate TTS" (🎤) button into DataGrid as column
   - Positioned alongside existing Accept (✓) and Delete (✖) buttons
   - Cleaner, more consistent row-level actions

2. **Enhanced Audio Column**
   - Changed from simple icon to informative metadata display
   - Shows: `—` if no audio
   - Shows: Voice name (e.g., `alloy`) if TTS-generated
   - Shows: Filename if user-imported
   - Icon prefix: `🎙️` for TTS, `📥` for imported, `—` for none

3. **PendingDialogueEntry Updates**
   - Added `TtsVoice` property to track voice used for generation
   - Updated `AudioSourceIcon` property logic
   - Enhanced `AudioStatusText` to show meaningful metadata

**Files Modified:**
- `MainWindow.xaml` - DataGrid columns updated
- `DiscoverySession.cs` - PendingDialogueEntry properties enhanced
- `MainWindow.xaml.cs` - Button click handlers added

### Track 2: Audio Manifest/Consolidation System ✅

**Architecture Implemented:**

```
AudioStore Service (Singleton)
├── Dictionary<dialogueId, AudioManifestEntry>
├── GenerateId(text) → SHA256 hash (16 chars)
├── SetAudioAsync() → Copy/Move to pack Audio folder
├── GetAudio() → Lookup by dialogue text
├── RemoveAudioAsync() → Delete file + manifest entry
├── LoadManifest() → Load from audio-manifest.json
└── SaveManifest() → Save to audio-manifest.json
```

**Key Features:**

1. **Stable Dialogue IDs**
   - SHA256 hash of normalized text
   - 16-character hex string
   - Consistent across sessions

2. **Manifest-Based Tracking**
   - Stored in `{pack}/Configuration/audio-manifest.json`
   - Format:
     ```json
     {
       "a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8": {
         "Path": "Audio/a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8.mp3",
         "VoiceName": "alloy",
         "IsGenerated": true,
         "UpdatedAt": "2025-10-09T..."
       }
     }
     ```

3. **File Consolidation**
   - **User-imported files**: Copied to `{pack}/Audio/`
   - **TTS-generated files**: Moved to `{pack}/Audio/` (deletes temp)
   - All paths relative to pack root
   - Prevents orphaned files

4. **Integration Points**
   - **Attach File Button**: Calls `AudioStore.SetAudioAsync(text, path, isGenerated: false)`
   - **Generate TTS Button**: Calls `AudioStore.SetAudioAsync(text, tempPath, isGenerated: true, voiceName)`
   - **Discovery Playback**: Uses `AudioStore.GetAudio(text)` for lookup
   - **Pack Load**: Calls `AudioStore.SetPackFolderAsync()` to load manifest

**Files Created:**
- `Services/AudioStore.cs` - Complete manifest management service

**Files Modified:**
- `DiscoveryService.cs` - Integrated AudioStore, updated TryPlayExistingAudio
- `MainWindow.xaml.cs` - Wired up AttachAudioFile_Click, GenerateTts_Click
- `App.xaml.cs` - Registered AudioStore in DI container

**Utility Methods Added:**
- `AudioStore.ValidateManifest()` - Finds missing audio files
- `AudioStore.FindOrphanedFiles()` - Finds files not in manifest
- `AudioStore.GetAllEntries()` - Diagnostic access to full manifest

## 📊 Complete Workflow

### User Attaches Audio File
```
1. User clicks 📎 button
2. File dialog opens
3. User selects .mp3/.wav/.ogg
4. AudioStore.SetAudioAsync() copies file to pack
5. Manifest updated with relative path
6. Entry.AudioPath = "Audio/{id}.mp3"
7. Entry.TtsVoice = null (marks as imported)
8. Activity Log: "📎 Attached: filename.mp3 → 'dialogue...'"
```

### User Generates TTS
```
1. User clicks 🎤 button
2. Check: API key configured?
3. Check: Speaker assigned?
4. Get voice from speaker profile
5. OpenAI TTS API call → temp file
6. AudioStore.SetAudioAsync() moves temp to pack
7. Manifest updated with voice name
8. Entry.AudioPath = "Audio/{id}.mp3"
9. Entry.TtsVoice = "alloy"
10. Activity Log: "✓ Generated TTS (alloy): 'dialogue...'"
```

### Discovery Loop Playback
```
1. Dialogue detected via OCR
2. Entry created and added to Discovered list
3. TryPlayExistingAudio() called
4. AudioStore.GetAudioEntry(text) checks manifest
5. If found: Get full path, play via AudioPlaybackService
6. Activity Log: "🔊 Playing audio (alloy): filename.mp3"
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Benefits

✅ **No Orphaned Files** - Manifest is single source of truth  
✅ **No Path Mismatches** - All paths relative to pack  
✅ **Portable Packs** - Audio consolidated in pack folder  
✅ **Clean Deletion** - Delete dialogue → delete audio automatically (future)  
✅ **Deduplication** - ID-based naming prevents duplicates  
✅ **Auditability** - Manifest shows all associations clearly  
✅ **Metadata Tracking** - Voice, generation status, timestamps stored  
✅ **Validation Tools** - Built-in methods to find issues

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Dependency Injection
```csharp
// AudioStore registered as singleton
services.AddSingleton<AudioStore>();

// Injected into:
- DiscoveryService (for playback lookup)
- MainWindow (for attach/generate workflows)
```

### TextNormalizer Integration
```csharp
// Static class - no DI needed
var normalized = TextNormalizer.Normalize(text);
```

### Error Handling
- Try/catch in all async operations
- User-friendly MessageBox on failures
- Detailed logging to Activity Log
- Graceful degradation (manifest missing = no playback)
