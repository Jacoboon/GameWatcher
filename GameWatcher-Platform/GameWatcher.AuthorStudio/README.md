# GameWatcher Author Studio

This project will house the authoring tools for creating dialogue packs and advanced authoring workflows.

Planned components:
- Discovery session manager
- Dialogue catalog builder
- Speaker analysis & voice generation
- Pack builder & validator

This is intentionally scoped small for V2 (dialogue cataloguing). The broader SDK and plugin vision will be addressed in V3+.
