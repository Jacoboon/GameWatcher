   - Required services per app
   - Common mistakes
   - Validation steps

5. **[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)**
   - Development workflow guide
   - Code style standards
   - Git conventions
   - Testing procedures
   - Common pitfalls

6. **[docs/SCRIPTS_REFERENCE.md](SCRIPTS_REFERENCE.md)**

   - Naming conventions

### Updated Documents

1. **[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)** (Platform-level)
   - Added critical notice to check APPLICATION_ARCHITECTURE.md
   - Explicit requirement: All three apps need capture pipeline
   - Warnings against inferring from code state

2. **[GameWatcher/AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)** (Root-level)
   - Added architecture compliance section
   - Mandatory service requirements noted
   - Cross-references to Platform docs

## Problem This Solves

### Before These Changes:
- No clear documentation of app responsibilities
- Easy to infer wrong purpose from minimal code
- No compliance checking before DI changes
- No contribution guidelines
- Inconsistent code formatting

### After These Changes:
- Clear architectural intent documented
- Mandatory service lists prevent breakage
- Quick reference checklists
- Developer onboarding guide
- Automated formatting standards

```

## Usage Workflows

### For New Developers
1. Read `GameWatcher-Platform/README.md`
2. Read `docs/design/APPLICATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md`
4. Start coding with confidence

### For Making DI Changes
1. Open `docs/design/APPLICATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`
2. Check required services for the app
3. Validate with `DI_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md`
4. Make changes
5. Test all three apps

### For Creating Game Packs
1. Read `docs/design/02-Game-Pack-System.md`
2. Reference `FF1.PixelRemaster` implementation
3. Follow pack creation guide in Platform README
4. Test with all three apps

### For Understanding Scripts
1. Open `docs/SCRIPTS_REFERENCE.md`
2. Find your task (build, voice gen, release, etc.)
3. Copy example command
4. Customize parameters

## Preventing Future Issues

The Studio capture services oversight is now prevented by:

1. **AGENTS.md** - "Check APPLICATION_ARCHITECTURE.md before modifying DI"
2. **APPLICATION_ARCHITECTURE.md** - "Studio MUST have capture services"
3. **DI_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md** - Quick checklist shows Studio needs ITextboxDetector, IOcrEngine, GameCaptureService
4. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - "Don't assume from code state - check design intent"

This multi-layered approach ensures both AI agents and human developers check architecture docs before making breaking changes.

## Recommendations Going Forward

### Maintain Documentation
- Update APPLICATION_ARCHITECTURE.md when adding required services
- Keep DI_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md current as apps evolve
- Add new design docs to the index
- Mark outdated docs in the status table

### Enforce Standards
- EditorConfig is now in place - IDEs will auto-format
- CONTRIBUTING.md defines conventions - reference in PRs
- Review checklist before merging DI changes

### Expand Over Time
- Add user guides to `docs/user/`
- Create pack author tutorials
- Document advanced features
- Add troubleshooting sections

## Impact Assessment

**Developer Experience:**
- ✅ Clear onboarding path
- ✅ Self-service documentation
- ✅ Prevents common mistakes
- ✅ Consistent code style

**Architecture Safety:**
- ✅ Mandatory services documented
- ✅ Quick validation checklists
- ✅ Anti-patterns called out
- ✅ Design intent preserved

**Maintenance Burden:**
- ⚠️ Docs need updates when architecture changes
- ✅ But prevents breaking changes and debugging time
- ✅ Helps future contributors understand intent

**Overall:** The documentation overhead is justified by the complexity (3 apps + shared engine + pack system). This prevents shipping broken releases.

## Version History

- **2025-10-08**: Initial comprehensive documentation added
- Trigger: Studio capture services oversight incident
- Purpose: Prevent architectural mistakes, improve DX
