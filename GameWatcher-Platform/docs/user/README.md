## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Application failed to start"
**Cause**: Missing .NET 8.0 Runtime  
**Solution**: Download from Microsoft and restart

#### "No packs detected"  
**Cause**: Pack directory configuration  
**Solution**: Use **Refresh Packs** button, check `appsettings.json`

#### "No game detected"
**Cause**: Game not running or unsupported  
**Solution**: Ensure supported game is active and pack is loaded

#### Performance Issues
**Cause**: System resource constraints  
**Solution**: Reduce capture FPS, enable optimizations, close background apps
