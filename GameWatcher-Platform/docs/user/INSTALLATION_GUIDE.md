    "EnableOptimization": true,
    "OptimizationThreshold": 0.90
  },
  "OCR": {
    "ConfidenceThreshold": 0.8,
    "EnablePreprocessing": true
  }
}
```

#### Low-Resource Configuration  
```json
{
  "Capture": {
    "TargetFps": 5,
    "EnableOptimization": true,
    "OptimizationThreshold": 0.75
  },
  "GameWatcher": {
    "DetectionIntervalMs": 5000
  }
}
```

## üéÆ Installing Game Packs

### Automatic Installation
1. Place pack folders in the `packs/` directory
2. Use **Refresh Packs** button in Pack Manager
3. Compatible packs will appear automatically

### Manual Pack Installation
1. Download pack from source (`.zip` or `.pack` file)
2. Extract to `packs/[PackName]/`
3. Ensure pack contains required files:
   - `pack-manifest.json`
   - Pack assembly (`.dll`)
   - Speaker profiles and audio files

### Pack Structure Verification
Verify your pack installation:
```
packs/YourGame.Pack/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pack-manifest.json        ‚úì Required
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ YourGame.Pack.dll        ‚úì Required

Monitor these in the Activity Monitor tab during operation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Installation

### Common Installation Issues

#### "Application failed to start"
**Cause**: Missing .NET 8.0 Runtime
**Solution**: 
1. Download .NET 8.0 Desktop Runtime from Microsoft
2. Install and restart system
3. Retry GameWatcher launch

#### "No packs detected"
**Cause**: Pack directory configuration issue
**Solution**:
1. Verify `packs/` folder exists in installation directory
2. Check `appsettings.json` PackDirectories configuration
3. Ensure FF1.PixelRemaster pack is present
4. Use **Refresh Packs** button

#### "Access denied" errors
**Cause**: Insufficient permissions
**Solution**:
1. Run GameWatcher as Administrator (first launch)
2. Ensure installation directory has write permissions
3. Check antivirus software isn't blocking files

#### High CPU/Memory usage
**Cause**: Performance configuration issues
**Solution**:
1. Reduce `TargetFps` in Capture settings
2. Increase `DetectionIntervalMs` 
3. Disable unnecessary optimization features
4. Monitor system resources in Activity Monitor

### Log Analysis
Check application logs for diagnostic information:
```
logs/gamewatcher-studio_YYYY-MM-DD.log
```

Common log indicators:
- **"Pack loaded successfully"** - Pack installation working
- **"Game detected"** - Game integration working  
- **"Processing frame in X.Xms"** - Performance metrics
- **"Error"/"Exception"** - Issues requiring attention

### Registry Cleanup (If Needed)
If using the installer and need to clean up:
```batch
# Remove GameWatcher registry entries (run as Administrator)
reg delete "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\GameWatcher" /f
reg delete "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\GameWatcher" /f
```

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Post-Installation Optimization

1. **Baseline Performance Test**:
   - Run Activity Monitor for 5 minutes during gameplay
   - Note average processing times and resource usage
   - Adjust settings if performance is below targets

2. **Game-Specific Tuning**:
   - Different games may benefit from different settings
   - Monitor detection success rates
   - Adjust confidence thresholds as needed

3. **System Resource Management**:
   - Close unnecessary background applications
   - Ensure adequate free RAM (4GB+ available)
   - Consider SSD installation for I/O intensive operations

### Windows Optimization
For best GameWatcher performance:
- **Disable Windows Game Mode** (can interfere with capture)
- **Set High Performance power plan**
- **Close Windows Game Bar** (Windows + G)
- **Disable Windows Game DVR**
