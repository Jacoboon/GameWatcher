# GameWatcher Author Studio User Guide

Welcome to GameWatcher Author Studio ‚Äî creation tools for building dialogue packs. Use this app when you want to discover, edit, voice, and package dialogue for use in GameWatcher Studio (the player app).

## Architecture (V2 Rebuild - October 2025)

Author Studio has been rebuilt using modern MVVM architecture to match GameWatcher Studio:
- **MVVM Pattern**: ViewModels with CommunityToolkit.Mvvm, proper data binding, RelayCommands
- **Dependency Injection**: Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection for services and ViewModels  
- **Logging**: Serilog with file and console outputs for troubleshooting
- **ModernWPF Theme**: Consistent dark theme matching Studio's visual design
- **Future-Ready**: Modular design supports V3+ expansion (Voice Lab, SDK plugins)

## Getting Started

- System requirements: Windows 10/11 (64-bit), .NET 8.0
- First launch: run `GameWatcher.AuthorStudio.exe`
- Logs: `logs/author-studio_<date>.log` for debugging
- Output: packaged packs that GameWatcher Studio can load and play

## Workflow Overview

### 1) Discovery Tab
- Start a discovery session to capture dialogue while playing a game.
- Live feed shows detected text; unique lines are added to the session list.
- Session status cards show: Status, Unique Lines Found, TTS Status
- Discovery log displays real-time capture events

### 2) Speakers Tab  
- Review speaker profiles: ID, Name, Voice, Speed, Effects
- Add/edit speakers manually or import from existing pack's `speakers.json`
- Preview button plays voice samples using Engine-level previews
- Effects field supports free-form tags (V3+ will add visual editor)

### 3) Voice Lab Tab (V3+ Placeholder)
- Future: Preset palette (Cave Echo, Throne Room, Random Pitch, etc.)
- Future: Effect chain editor with drag-and-drop reordering
- Future: Real-time auditioning with A/B compare
- Future: Per-effect randomness for variation
- Future: DSL export for advanced users

### 4) Pack Builder Tab
- Fill in pack metadata: Pack Name, Display Name, Version
- Output Folder: where the pack will be exported
- Open Pack: load existing pack for editing
- Export Pack: build and package the complete pack

### 5) Settings Tab
- **Audio Format**: Choose `wav` or `mp3` for generated audio
- **TTS API Key**: Save/Remove OpenAI API key (stored as `GWS_OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- Status messages show success/failure of operations

## Using Your Pack in GameWatcher Studio

- Place the built pack in a directory scanned by the player:
  - Default: `./packs/` next to the player executable, or
  - Any folder you added under Settings ‚Üí Pack Directories in GameWatcher Studio
- Open GameWatcher Studio, go to Pack Manager, Load your pack, and play.

## Tips

- Keep discovery sessions focused (per area or chapter) for clean catalogs.
- Normalize punctuation and spacing for better matching.
- Favor shorter voice previews while tuning settings; switch to bulk when satisfied.
- Use logging (`logs/author-studio_*.log`) to troubleshoot issues

## TTS API Key (OpenAI)

- Configure TTS from Settings tab: paste your key into the password box and Save
- The app stores it in your user environment as `GWS_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- You can Remove the key at any time from the same tab
- Top bar shows status: `TTS ready` or `TTS unavailable: Configure key`
- If no key is set, TTS actions are disabled
- Advanced: a legacy fallback reads `Secrets/openai-api-key.txt` (first line). You can also set `GAMEWATCHER_SECRETS_DIR` to point at a folder containing that file.

## Voice Previews (Engine-Level)

- Speaker previews use engine-level cached audio from `GameWatcher.Engine/Voices/`
- Format: `<voice>-<speed>.mp3` (e.g., `alloy-1.2.mp3`)
- Sample phrase: "Hi! I'm <Name>. Calm. Excited! Curious? Let's begin."
- Previews are generated once and cached for reuse
- Batch generation script: `scripts/generate_engine_previews.ps1` (for developers)

## Architecture Details (for Developers)

### Dependency Injection
Services and ViewModels are registered in `App.xaml.cs`:
- **Services**: DiscoveryService, SpeakerStore, OpenAiTtsService, PackExporter, etc.
- **ViewModels**: MainWindowViewModel, DiscoveryViewModel, SpeakersViewModel, etc.
- All dependencies injected via constructor, enabling testability and modularity

### MVVM Data Flow
```
View (MainWindow.xaml)
  ‚Üì DataContext
ViewModel (MainWindowViewModel)
  ‚Üì Commands/Properties
Services (DiscoveryService, TtsService, etc.)
  ‚Üì Business Logic
Models (PendingDialogueEntry, SpeakerProfile)
```

### Future V3+ Extensibility
The architecture is designed for plugin-based expansion:
- Voice Lab: Full effects editor (reverb, pitch, EQ, compression)
- SDK Modules: Fantasy gaming, analytics, custom events
- Community Plugins: Extension points for advanced features

## Troubleshooting

### App won't start
- Check `logs/author-studio_<date>.log` for startup errors
- Verify .NET 8.0 Runtime is installed
- Try running from command line: `dotnet run --project GameWatcher.AuthorStudio.csproj`

### TTS not working
- Verify API key is set in Settings tab
- Check environment variable: `[Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("GWS_OPENAI_API_KEY", "User")`
- Review logs for TTS-related errors

### Discovery session not capturing
- Ensure target game window is visible and active
- Check Engine configuration in appsettings.json
- Review logs for OCR/detection errors
